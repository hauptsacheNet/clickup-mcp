# ClickUp MCP for AI Assistants

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enabling AI assistants to interact with ClickUp workspaces. Get complete task context with comments and images, search across projects, create and update tasks, collaborate through comments, and track time - all through natural language.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Software Notice**  
> This MCP is experimental and under active development. While implemented with great care to prevent data loss through append-only description updates and other safety measures, it cannot be guaranteed to be completely safe. Please use with caution, especially in production environments. Always test in a non-critical workspace first. üß™

## What You Can Do

Turn natural language into powerful ClickUp actions:

**Agentic Coding & Development:**
- *"Look at CU-abc123, can you find the relevant code?"*
- *"Can you build the dashboard like described in https://app.clickup.com/t/12a23b45c?"*
- *"Check task CU-xyz789 and fix the bugs mentioned in the comments"*
- *"Implement the API endpoints described in the integration task"*

**Time Tracking & Productivity:**
- *"Book 2 hours for the client meeting on the XYZ project"*
- *"How much time did I spend on development tasks this week?"*
- *"Log 30 minutes for code review on the authentication feature"*

**Smart Search & Discovery:**
- *"What task did I mention the CSV import in?"*
- *"Find all tasks related to the payment gateway integration"*
- *"Show me tasks where users reported login issues"*

**Daily Workflow Management:**
- *"What do I need to do today?"*
- *"Create a task for fixing the dashboard bug in the frontend list"*
- *"Update the API documentation task to 'in review' status"*
- *"What tasks are blocking the mobile app release?"*

**Rich Context & Collaboration:**
- *"Show me all comments on the user authentication task"*
- *"What's the latest update on the database migration?"*
- *"Add a comment to the design task about the new wireframes"*

**Document Management:**
- *"Find documents about job posting in hauptsache.net space"*
- *"Search for API documentation across all spaces"*
- *"Read the API documentation in the development space"*
- *"Create a new requirements document for the mobile app project"*
- *"Update the meeting notes with today's decisions"*
- *"What documents are in the product strategy space?"*

## Setup for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or Cursor

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Your `CLICKUP_API_KEY` (Profile Icon > Settings > Apps > API Token ~ usually starts with pk_)
   - and your `CLICKUP_TEAM_ID` (The ~7 digit number in the url when you are in the settings)

2. **Configuration**:
   Add the following to your MCP configuration file:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "clickup": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "@hauptsache.net/clickup-mcp@latest"
         ],
         "env": {
           "CLICKUP_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
           "CLICKUP_TEAM_ID": "your_team_id"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `your_api_key` and `your_team_id` with your actual ClickUp credentials.

3. **Connect Your AI Assistant**:
   - **Claude Desktop**: Add this configuration in Settings > Developer > Edit Config
   - **Windsurf**: Add to your MCP configuration file
   - **Cursor**: Configure through the MCP settings panel

## MCP Modes & Available Tools

### Setting the Mode

Add the mode to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clickup": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hauptsache.net/clickup-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "CLICKUP_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "CLICKUP_TEAM_ID": "your_team_id",
        "CLICKUP_MCP_MODE": "read"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

This MCP server can be configured using environment variables:

- `CLICKUP_API_KEY`: (Required) Your ClickUp API key.
- `CLICKUP_TEAM_ID`: (Required) Your ClickUp Team ID (formerly Workspace ID).
- `CLICKUP_MCP_MODE`: (Optional) Controls which tools are available. Options: `read-minimal`, `read`, `write` (default).
- `MAX_IMAGES`: (Optional) The maximum number of images to return for a task in `getTaskById`. Defaults to 4.
- `MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_MB`: (Optional) The maximum response size in megabytes for `getTaskById`. Uses intelligent size budgeting to fit the most important images within the limit. Defaults to 1.
- `CLICKUP_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE`: (Optional) A hint for the primary language used in your ClickUp tasks (e.g., "de" for German, "en" for English). This helps the `searchTask` tool provide more tailored guidance in its description for multilingual searches.
- `LANG`: (Optional) If `CLICKUP_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE` is not set, the MCP will check this standard environment variable (e.g., "en_US.UTF-8", "de_DE") as a fallback to infer the primary language.

### Language-Aware Search Guidance

The `searchTask` tool's description will dynamically adjust based on the detected primary language:
- If `CLICKUP_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE` or `LANG` suggests a known primary language (e.g., German), the tool's description will specifically recommend providing search terms in both English and that detected language (e.g., German) for optimal results.
- If no primary language is detected, a more general recommendation for multilingual workspaces will be provided.

This feature aims to improve search effectiveness when the language of user queries (often English) differs from the language of the tasks in ClickUp, without making the MCP itself perform translations. The responsibility for providing bilingual search terms still lies with the agent calling the MCP, but the MCP offers more specific advice if it has a language hint.

## Markdown Formatting Support

Task descriptions and list documentation support full markdown formatting:

### Examples

**Task Creation with Markdown:**
```
Create a task called "API Integration" with description:
# API Integration Requirements

## Authentication
- Implement OAuth 2.0 flow
- Add JWT token validation
- **Priority**: High security standards

## Endpoints
1. `/api/users` - User management
2. `/api/data` - Data retrieval
3. `/api/webhook` - Event notifications

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for auth flow
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Load testing with 1000+ concurrent users

> **Note**: This replaces the legacy REST implementation

See related task: https://app.clickup.com/t/abc123
```

**Append-Only Updates (Safe):**
When updating task descriptions, content is safely appended:
```markdown
[Existing task description content]

---
**Edit (2024-01-15):** Added new acceptance criteria based on client feedback:
- Must support mobile responsive design
- Performance requirement: < 2s load time
```

This ensures no existing content is ever lost while maintaining a clear audit trail.

## Performance & Limitations

**Optimized for AI Workflows:**
- **Smart Image Processing**: Intelligent size budgeting prioritizes the most recent images while respecting both count (`MAX_IMAGES`, default: 4) and total response size limits (`MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_MB`, default: 1MB)
- **Search Scope**: Searches within the most recent 1000-3000 tasks to prevent running into rate limits (exact number varies by endpoint)
- **Search Results**: Returns up to 50 most relevant matches to prevent flooding the agent with too many results

**Current Scope:**
- Focused on task-level operations rather than bulk workspace management
- Optimized for conversational AI workflows rather than data migration
- Designed for productivity enhancement, not administrative operations

These limitations ensure reliable performance while covering the most common use cases for both development context and productivity management.
